      <h2>The basics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use it how you like.</strong> Personal or business - Intersect Studio works on your devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscriptions and lifetime purchase.</strong> Monthly, yearly, or one-time. Free trial where available.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple handles billing.</strong> Manage subscriptions in iOS Settings. Refunds go through Apple.</li>
        <li><strong>Be reasonable.</strong> Don't hack the app or try to break things.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>These are the terms for using <strong>Intersect Studio</strong> (the "App"), made by <strong>Bohdan Yatsyniuk</strong> (the "Developer", "we", "us"). By using the app, you're agreeing to these terms.</p>
      <p><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:intersect.studio.app@gmail.com">intersect.studio.app@gmail.com</a> or visit our <a href="../contact/">Contact page</a></p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Using the app</h2>
      <p>You can use Intersect Studio on devices you own or control, for personal or business purposes. This license follows these terms and Apple's App Store rules.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Purchases and subscriptions</h2>

      <h3>What's available</h3>
      <p>We offer monthly and yearly subscriptions, plus a lifetime purchase option. All unlock the same Pro features.</p>

      <h3>Free trial</h3>
      <p>Subscriptions come with a free trial (where available). One trial per Apple ID per subscription type, following Apple's rules.</p>

      <h3>Billing and renewals</h3>
      <p>Apple charges your account when you confirm a purchase. Subscriptions renew automatically unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the current period ends. Manage or cancel anytime in <strong>iOS Settings › Apple ID › Subscriptions</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Restoring purchases</h3>
      <p>Pro features work as long as you have an active subscription or lifetime purchase. You can restore purchases anytime in the app.</p>

      <h3>Refunds</h3>
      <p>Apple handles all refunds. The app includes a link to request a refund for your latest Pro purchase.</p>

      <h3>Price changes</h3>
      <p>We might adjust prices for new purchases or renewals. Apple will notify you of changes. Continuing to use the app after a price change means you accept the new price.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>What you can't do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't try to break the app or interfere with how it works</li>
        <li>Don't attempt to bypass purchase verification or hack Pro features</li>
        <li>Don't reverse engineer the app (unless your local laws explicitly allow it)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You're responsible for your device, backups, and following applicable laws.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Ownership</h2>
      <p>We own Intersect Studio and all its content. You get to use it, but we keep the intellectual property rights. Some third-party libraries are included under their own licenses.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>How we handle your data is covered in our <a href="../privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>. The short version: your scenes stay on your device, and we collect minimal analytics.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Third-party services</h2>
      <p>The app uses Apple's StoreKit for purchases and third-party services for analytics and crash reporting. Those services have their own terms and privacy policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>We provide the app as-is. We can't promise it'll work perfectly all the time or meet every specific need you might have. While we work hard to keep things running smoothly, software is complex and issues can happen.</p>
      <p>To the extent the law allows, we don't make guarantees beyond what's written here.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Liability limits</h2>
      <p>If something goes wrong, our liability is capped at the greater of (a) what you paid us in the last 12 months, or (b) EUR 50.</p>
      <p>We're not liable for indirect damages, lost data, or business interruption. That said, nothing here limits our liability for things we can't legally limit - like personal injury from negligence or fraud.</p>
      
      <div class="terms-note">
        <strong>EU/UK consumers:</strong> These terms don't reduce your mandatory consumer rights under local law.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Ending access</h2>
      <p>We can suspend or stop your access if you seriously violate these terms or if we're required to by law. You can stop using the app anytime. When access ends, your license to use it ends too.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Governing law</h2>
      <p>These terms are governed by Polish law, and disputes would be handled in Warsaw, Poland - unless your local consumer protection laws require otherwise.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Changes to these terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these terms occasionally. When we do, we'll post the new version here and update the date at the top. For major changes, we might add a notice in the app.</p>
    </section>
