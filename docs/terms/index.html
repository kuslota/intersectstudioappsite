    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: October 20, 2025</p>

    <div class="panel">
      <p>These Terms and Conditions (the "Terms") govern your use of the Intersect Studio iOS/iPadOS application (the "App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
      <p>In these Terms, "Developer" means <strong>Bohdan Yatsyniuk</strong>.</p>

      <h2>1. License</h2>
      <p>We grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal (or internal business) purposes on devices you own or control, in accordance with these Terms and Apple’s App Store Terms.</p>

      <h2>2. In‑App Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Products.</strong> The App offers auto‑renewing subscriptions (monthly and yearly) and a lifetime non‑consumable purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Free trials.</strong> Subscriptions may include a free trial (currently two weeks where available). One trial per Apple ID per subscription group, subject to Apple’s rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Billing & renewal.</strong> Payment is charged to your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the current period ends. Manage or cancel in iOS Settings › Apple ID › Subscriptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Entitlements & restore.</strong> Pro features are available while an active subscription or lifetime purchase is present. You can restore purchases within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Refunds.</strong> Refunds are handled by Apple. The App provides a link/flow to request a refund for the latest Pro transaction (StoreKit 2).</li>
        <li><strong>Price changes.</strong> We may change prices for future purchases or renewals. Apple may notify you of changes; continued use after the change indicates consent to the new price.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not misuse the App, interfere with its normal operation, attempt to bypass purchase checks, or reverse engineer components except as permitted by law.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for your device, backups, and compliance with applicable laws.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>The App and all related materials are owned by <strong>the Developer</strong> and its licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. All rights not expressly granted are reserved. Third‑party components are used under their respective licenses.</p>

      <h2>5. Privacy</h2>
      <p>Your use of the App is also subject to our <a href="../privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains what data we process and why.</p>

      <h2>6. Third‑Party Services</h2>
      <p>The App uses Apple’s StoreKit for purchases and third‑party analytics and crash‑reporting services for product improvement. Your use of those services is subject to their terms and privacy policies.</p>

      <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties (express or implied), including fitness for a particular purpose and non‑infringement. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted or error‑free.</p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, <strong>the Developer</strong> will not be liable for any indirect, consequential, special, incidental, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, arising out of or related to your use of the App. Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Our total aggregate liability for all claims relating to the App shall not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid for the App and in‑app purchases in the preceding twelve (12) months, or (b) EUR 50. If you are a consumer in the EEA/UK, these Terms do not reduce your mandatory consumer rights.</p>

      <h2>9. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the App if you materially breach these Terms or if required by law. You may stop using the App at any time. Upon termination, license rights end immediately.</p>

      <h2>10. Governing Law & Venue</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Poland</strong>, without regard to conflict‑of‑laws rules. Courts located in <strong>Warsaw, Poland</strong> shall have exclusive jurisdiction, unless otherwise required by applicable consumer law. This is without prejudice to mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence.</p>

      <h2>11. Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated version here and update the effective date above. If changes are material, we may provide an in‑app notice.</p>
