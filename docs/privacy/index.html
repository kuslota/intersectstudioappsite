    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: October 20, 2025</p>

    <div class="panel">
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Bohdan Yatsyniuk</strong> ("Developer", "we", "us") handles information in the Intersect Studio iOS/iPadOS application (the "App"). It is written to be clear and practical and to help you understand what we do - and do not do - with data.</p>

  <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
  <p>Controller: <strong>Bohdan Yatsyniuk</strong> ("Developer").</p>
  <p>Contact: <a href="mailto:intersect.studio.app@gmail.com">intersect.studio.app@gmail.com</a> • <a href="../contact/">Contact</a></p>

  <h2>2. Scope</h2>
  <p>This policy covers the App. It does not describe third‑party sites we link to. The marketing site is a simple GitHub Pages site and does not place tracking cookies.</p>

  <h2>3. The short version</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No accounts and no cloud sync. Your scenes, settings, and saved poses stay on your device unless you back them up via iCloud device backup.</li>
    <li>We write images to your Photos library only when you choose to export; we do not read your existing Photos.</li>
    <li>We use limited analytics to improve performance and reliability. We do not use advertising identifiers or tracking.</li>
    <li>Purchases are processed by Apple; we do not receive your payment card or Apple ID information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data we process</h2>
  <p><strong>On‑device data (not sent to us):</strong> Settings and saved poses are stored locally on your device in the app’s storage. We do not operate a content server and do not receive your scenes or images.</p>

  <p><strong>Photos (with permission):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>When you export, the App writes rendered images to your Photos library using the <em>Photos Add‑Only</em> permission. The App does not read or scan your existing library.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Purchases:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information about your purchase (e.g., product type, subscription status such as renewal or expiry) and Apple transaction identifiers needed to grant or restore Pro access. We do not receive payment card details.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Analytics & diagnostics:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Event data about feature usage (e.g., adding/duplicating forms, toggling settings), device and app metadata (device model, OS/app version, language/region), anonymized crash data.</li>
    <li>No advertising IDs, no contact information, no precise location, and no linkage to a user account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Why we process data (purposes & legal bases)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Provide the App and Pro entitlements</strong> (export to Photos, verify purchases, restore access). <em>Legal basis:</em> performance of a contract (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b)).</li>
    <li><strong>Improve performance, stability, and UX</strong> via analytics and crash diagnostics. <em>Legal basis:</em> our legitimate interests (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)).</li>
    <li><strong>Security, fraud prevention, and compliance</strong> (e.g., preventing abuse of refunds/trials). <em>Legal basis:</em> legitimate interests and/or legal obligation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">You may request deletion of server‑side analytics (see Your rights below).</p>

  <h2>6. Sharing & processors</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple Inc.</strong> Processes purchases and subscription lifecycle. We receive no payment card or Apple ID details.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics and diagnostics service providers.</strong> Provide aggregated usage measurement and crash reporting to improve performance and reliability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell or share your personal information for cross‑context behavioral advertising (CPRA). We do not disclose data to other third parties except as required by law.</p>

  <h2>7. Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On‑device content</strong> persists until you delete it or uninstall the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics data</strong> is retained for up to <strong>14 months</strong>, and <strong>diagnostic data</strong> (including crash reports) for about <strong>90 days</strong>, after which it is automatically deleted by our analytics and diagnostics provider.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase records</strong> are retained as long as needed to provide entitlements and comply with accounting/legal requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. International transfers</h2>
  <p>Our service providers may process data on servers outside your country (including the United States). When data is transferred internationally, we rely on appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent mechanisms.</p>

  <h2>9. Your rights</h2>
  <p>If you are in the EEA/UK (and, where applicable, other regions), you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict or object to processing, and data portability. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</p>
  <p>To make a request, email <a href="mailto:intersect.studio.app@gmail.com">intersect.studio.app@gmail.com</a>. We may ask for basic technical details (app version, device model) to locate records. Where deletion applies to server‑side analytics or diagnostics, we will request deletion from our service provider.</p>

  <h2>10. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children. Do not use the App if you are under 13 (or under 16 in the EEA/UK) without parental consent. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>11. Security</h2>
  <p>We use platform security features (sandboxing, data protection at rest). No method of storage or transmission is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>12. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated version here and update the effective date above.</p>

  <h2>13. Contact</h2>
  <p>Questions or requests: <a href="mailto:intersect.studio.app@gmail.com">intersect.studio.app@gmail.com</a> • <a href="../contact/">Contact</a></p>
